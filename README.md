## Overview
The INDOT Autonomous Mower Project is designed to create an autonomous robotic platform capable of safely and efficiently mowing designated roadside areas. This project uses a combination of **ROS2**, **computer vision**, **GPS**, **IMU**, and **LiDAR** technologies for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

This README provides an overview of the projectâ€™s setup, configuration, and usage instructions for contributors and users.

## Project Goals
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Enable the mower to navigate complex outdoor environments using GPS, IMU, and LiDAR.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Implement obstacle detection and avoidance to ensure safety.
- **Data Logging**: Record sensor data for analysis and continuous improvement.
- **Environment Mapping**: Develop high-accuracy maps to assist in path planning and navigation.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize the system to operate efficiently and extend battery life.

## Features
- **Real-time Navigation**: Uses **Nav2** for autonomous path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from **GPS**, **IMU**, **LiDAR**, and **radar** for accurate positioning and navigation.
- **Data Recording**: Logs relevant data for later analysis and debugging.
- **Simulation Support**: Offers Gazebo simulation for development and testing in a virtual environment.

## Usage
Launching the Simulation
To test in a simulated environment:

```
ros2 launch indot_mower simulation.launch.py
```

Running the Autonomous Mower
For real-world deployment:

```
ros2 launch indot_mower mower.launch.py
```

Recording Data
To record relevant data (excluding unnecessary topics):

```
ros2 bag record --all
```

## Project Structure
**src:** Contains the main ROS2 packages for navigation, perception, and control.
launch: Launch files for simulation and real-world deployment.
config: Configuration files for sensors, navigation parameters, and tuning.
data: Folder for collected datasets, logs, and ROS2 bag files.
scripts: Utility scripts for data processing, analysis, and configuration setup.

## Data Collection
This project includes modules for recording sensor data:

**ROS2 Bag:** Record all relevant topics, excluding unnecessary topics.
**CSV Logging:** Logs GPS, IMU, and LiDAR data in CSV format for post-analysis.

## Configuration
Adjust the parameters in the config/ directory to fine-tune navigation, sensor thresholds, and control parameters.

Examples:

**GPS Configuration:** Set parameters such as update frequency and accuracy.
**LiDAR Filtering:** Configure point cloud filtering based on range and intensity.
