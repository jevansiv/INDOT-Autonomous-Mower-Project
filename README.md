## Project Structure
**Unreal Project:** Contains virtual environments, vehicle models, and sensors for developing navigation methods in specific environments and scenarios. This is where your testbed can be augmented for evaluating a vehicle's autonomy to safely navigate within a desired mowing coverage region. Vehicle models include the Evans' lab open-source connected autonomous rover (OSCAR) and RC Mower TK-44E build. Developer's can model and import their own vehicles to this project.

**oscar_ros:** Contains navigation, perception, and control ROS2 launch scripts and interface scripts for the autonomous mower. This is an example of what a navigation software stack will be like (e.g., Nav2) that is provided for the open-source connected autonomous rover (OSCAR). Developers can model off of this structure for their own robot platforms.

**Scripts:** Contains additional supplement scripts for filtering data entries to navigation, such as limiting data inputs to a specified region in the field-of-view of a sensor. These scripts are dependent on the autonomy setups for your navigation package, will vary to your own work.

<!-- **src:** Contains the main ROS2 packages for navigation, perception, and control.
launch: Launch files for simulation and real-world deployment.
config: Configuration files for sensors, navigation parameters, and tuning.
data: Folder for collected datasets, logs, and ROS2 bag files.
scripts: Utility scripts for data processing, analysis, and configuration setup.-->

## Custom Environment Setup
![Custom Environment Image](Images/Digital_Twin_Example.png)

A digital twin environment can be generated with:
  - [TerraForm Pro](https://www.terraformpro.com/)
  - [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-ion/)
  - [Point clouds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lidar-point-cloud-plugin-quick-start-guide-in-unreal-engine)

**Note:** Custom environment noise can be added by animals (e.g., [Animal Variety Pack](https://www.fab.com/listings/2dd7964c-a601-4264-a53d-465dcae1644c)) and neighboring vehicles traveling on the road (e.g., [Vehicle Variety Pack](https://www.fab.com/listings/dc1ada50-2523-44b1-b0e2-a72d14076fb4)).

## Custom Vehicle Setup
![Custom Vehicle Image](Images/vehicles_side_road.png)

A custom vehicle can be imported and configured in ROWMow Sim. To do this, the following steps must be performed.
- Produce a CAD (or virtual) model of the vehicle
- Import the model into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- Rig your vehicle with the bones and proper orientation (Here is an example [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loRhQn1zwpE))
- Export vehicle as FBX from Blender and import vehicle as FBX to Unreal Engine
- Set vehicle physics in Unreal Engine
- Copy over ROS2 configuration blueprint details from OSCAR or other developed platform

**Note:** Advanced models (e.g., tractor with flex-wing mower) require [Advanced Vehicle System](https://www.fab.com/listings/e1457ad1-297b-4a70-aecb-5c6716d9494f) plugin.

## Sensor Setup
Sensors are blueprints in the content browser that can be pulled into the vehicle and configured in the vehicle's blueprint for ROS2 configuration. OSCAS's blueprint can be used for reference to develop custom configurations. These sensors were developed upon [rclUE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/rclUE/tree/UE5_devel_humble) and [RapyutaSimulationPlugins](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/RapyutaSimulationPlugins/tree/devel) with added sensor types and noise modeling.

### Sensor options:
 - GPS
 - IMU
 - RGB Camera
 - Depth Camera
 - FLIR Camera
 - Ultrasonic
 - Radar
 - LiDAR

## Data Collection
This project includes modules for recording sensor data:

- **ROS2 Bag:** Record all relevant topics, excluding unnecessary topics.

## Results
Here, you can detail the experimental results of your autonomous mower:

- Mowing coverage performance
