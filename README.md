## Overview
The INDOT Autonomous Mower Project is designed to create an autonomous robotic platform capable of safely and efficiently mowing designated roadside areas. This project uses a combination of **ROS2**, **Unreal Engine**, and **TerraForm Pro** to develop digital-twin roadsides for mowing navigation along a coverage region and obstacle avoidance.

This README provides an overview of the projectâ€™s setup, configuration, and usage instructions for contributors and users.

- Reinforcement learning based navigation and obstacle avoidance

## Project Goals
- **Real-World Testsites**: Generate real-world locations for simulation testing to target improvements to sim2real transfers.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Enable autonomous mower research to navigate roadsides using GPS, IMU, and a coupled obstacle detection sensor.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Implement obstacle detection methods with an advanced sensor suite.
- **Data Logging**: Record sensor data for analysis and continuous improvement.
- **Safety Analysis**: Develop safety report from recorded sensor data for analysis by developers.
- **Vehicle Configuration**: Optimize the system based on a developer's vehicle, software, and sensors for maximizing mowing efficiency and safety.

## Features
- **Real-time Navigation**: Uses custom user developed **Nav2** or **RL** methods for autonomous path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from sensors for positioning and navigation with adjustable sampling rates and noise.
- **Data Recording**: Logs relevant data for later analysis and debugging.
- **Simulation Support**: Offers a high-fidelity Unreal Engine 5.1 simulation for development and testing of vegetation management platforms in a virtual environment.

  - Press the green arrow button to run the project generation
### Launching the Simulation (Example Demonstrations with OSCAR Platform):
To test in a simulated environment:
- **Launch the Unreal Engine Project in vscode**
  - Use: Launch Test_Segment_1 Editor (DebugGame) (UE5)
- **Select the map desired from the content browser**
- **Implement the mowing vehicle into the environment if platform does not already exist in environment**
  - Set the autopossess player to player 0 from disabled if it is disabled
- **Play the simulated environment**
- **Launch the external ros2 connection for the GPS sensor in a terminal:**
```
source ~/oscar_ros/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch oscar_ros launch_sim_gps.launch.py
```
- **Launch the external Nav2 controller in a terminal:**
```
source ~/oscar_ros_ws/install/setup.bash
cd ~/oscar_ros_ws/src/oscar_ros/config/sim
ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py params_file:=./<nav2_param_yaml_file>.yaml map:=../../maps/<map_yaml_file>.yaml use_sim_time:= true
```
  - An example launch commmand used for obstacle avoidance from files in oscar_ros package:
```
ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py params_file:=./nav2_params_pcloud.yaml map:=../../maps/empty_map.yaml use_sim_time:= true
```
- **Launch RViz2 for visualized view of robot's inputs and outputs:**
```
source ~/oscar_ros/install/setup.bash
rviz2
```
  - (Optional) Send goal poses in RViz2
- **(Optional) Run external navigation to send goal poses in a terminal:**
```
source ~/oscar_ros_ws/install/setup.bash
cd /<path_to_waypoint_publisher_file>
python3 <waypoint_publisher_file>.py
```
- **Recording Data**
  - To record a rosbag of sensor data:
```
source ~/oscar_ros_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 bag record --all
```
  - To record simulation data at end of test:
